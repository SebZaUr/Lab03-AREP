## University Electives Consultant

***

### Description

This project has two parts: One is a RESTful API in Java that allows querying the elective courses available for university programs. The API provides endpoints to obtain detailed information about electives, including name, code, credits, type, prerequisites, and the academic program to which they belong.  
The other is a web application made with JavaScript that allows me to filter the API information by different academic programs.

### Features

* Elective Course Query: Get the complete list of available elective courses.
* Course Details: Query specific details of an elective course, including credits and prerequisites.
* Filter by Program: Filter the available elective courses according to the academic program.
* Data Format: JSON response format.

## Application architecture üìê

This application is a web client that runs in the browser and uses JSON for message formatting. It acts as a facade server, encapsulating calls to external web services over HTTP.


The application modules are as follows:
* __SpringECI:__ Let us start the application.
* __Annotations:__ Create all the annotations that we need on the project (example: **@GetMapping**,**@RequestMapping**,**@RequestParam**).
* __IoCContainer:__ Is an implementation of an Inversion of Control (IoC) container that manages the creation and handling of REST controllers and their endpoints.
* __ClientHandler:__ Let us handing all HTTP requests from clients.
* __SimpleWebServer:__ A basic web server that listens for HTTP requests on a specific port.
